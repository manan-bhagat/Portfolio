									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Methodology</h2>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</strong> Sales data was extracted from SharePoint and imported into PowerBI for initial processing. This included cleaning, normalization, and merging of tables to ensure a cohesive dataset.</li>
										<li><strong>ETL Process:</strong> The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process was used to refine the data. Normalized tables were merged, and data modeling was performed to structure the data appropriately for analysis.</li>
										<li><strong>Data Modeling:</strong> Data modeling involved creating relationships between different tables, defining measures and calculated columns, and ensuring the data model supports the analytical requirements. A specific challenge was integrating a currency table with daily prices to accurately calculate total sales.</li>
										<li><strong>Visualization Development:</strong> Visuals were created in PowerBI according to stakeholder requirements, with a focus on conveying actionable business insights. These visuals included sales trends, customer segmentation, and performance metrics to provide a comprehensive view of the business.</li>
										<li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Conducting EDA to uncover patterns and insights within the data, such as identifying high-performing products, seasonal trends, and regional sales distribution.</li>
										<li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Developing and deploying predictive models to forecast sales and customer behavior. Techniques include regression analysis, classification, and clustering to segment customers and predict future trends.</li>
										<li><strong>Interactive Dashboards:</strong> Using tools like Tableau and PowerBI to create interactive dashboards that present data in a clear and actionable manner. Dashboards include metrics like yearly, monthly, and weekly sales, sales per branch, and customer transaction analysis.</li>
									</ul>
									
									
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Analysis</h2>
