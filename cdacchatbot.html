										<h1>CDAC Chatbot</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Institutions like the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) cater to a diverse range of students seeking admissions or information on various courses. To streamline this process and provide personalized assistance, we present an advanced machine learning model leveraging Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). Our model efficiently analyzes a custom-made dataset to assist students in exploring admission opportunities and course inquiries at CDAC. Utilizing sophisticated natural language processing techniques, our chatbot categorizes and responds to student queries, offering tailored recommendations and guidance. This approach enhances the student experience and improves the efficiency of CDAC's information dissemination process, ensuring timely and relevant support.</p>
